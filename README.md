# predicting_bike_sharing_patterns
Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns  - 1st project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

Bike sharing In this project, make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, we will understand much better how gradient descent, backpropagation, and other important concepts of neural networks work. The data comes from the UCI [Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
